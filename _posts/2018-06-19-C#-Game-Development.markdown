My latest job requires me to code in C#. In order to hone my skills, I will begin game development in Unity. I will most likely code in Windows and this will be the first time I have coded a personal project in Windows. Luckily, my PC monitor is a huge 55" monitor so it'll be easier to spot bugs.

I have no idea what my first game will be. I'll start out with a 2D game just to learn the fundamentals, but it probably won't be something new or unique. Then, I will make a 3D game and i'll try to make it as unique as I can.
