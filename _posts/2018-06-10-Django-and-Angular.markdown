I've made a few apps that use Django for the backend and Angular for the frontend, but only with Angular version 1. Angular 2 and later versions are drastically different. Angular 6 is the latest versions but i've found online tutorials that use Angular 4, so I will probably use that. I'm going to keep building web apps until I fully understand how to make a full featured app where I control every aspect of deployment.
