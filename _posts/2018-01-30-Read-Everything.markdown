Just a note that it's important to read all of the documentation of the frameworks and services
that you are using. I didn't think I needed to know that much about Jekyll for building this
website, but there are a lot of features that make designing this website much easier than doing it
from scratch. For example, I was using code to load in my header and footer files but Jekyll already
has tools set up to do that for you. So I had two copies of header and footer files and half my code
was using one group and the other half was using the other group.
