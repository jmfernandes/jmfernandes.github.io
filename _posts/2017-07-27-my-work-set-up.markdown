This post is to document all the programs I use on my work laptop. First all my writing is done with [Atom][atom-link]. I use this because not only does it provide a lot of the same features that Sublime text has, but it can also be used as a Latex compiler. The current list of packages I have installed are


- autoclose-html
- autocomplete-python
- kite
- language-latex
- latex
- linter
- linter-htmlhint
- minimap-plus
- pigments

I also use the [cd to][cd-link] tool to be able to open a terminal window in the current finder directory. It makes it easy to always make sure you are in the correct directory for running git commands or other folder specific commands. Lastly, I run [flux][flux-link] to make sure that I don't stay up late coding.
